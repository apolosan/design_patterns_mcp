### Added

#### Kotlin Design Patterns Integration

Successfully integrated 14 Kotlin-specific design patterns and best practices identified from "Functional Programming in Kotlin" and "Kotlin Design Patterns and Best Practices":

- **Coroutines Pattern**: Lightweight threads for asynchronous programming
- **Structured Concurrency Pattern**: Manages coroutine lifecycles with automatic cancellation
- **Channels Pattern**: Communication primitive for coroutine-based producer-consumer patterns
- **Flows Pattern**: Cold asynchronous streams for reactive programming
- **Sequences Pattern**: Lazy collections for efficient data processing
- **Data Classes Pattern**: Immutable data containers with automatic equals/hashCode/copy

- **Extension Functions Pattern**: Adding methods to existing classes without inheritance
- **Operator Overloading Pattern**: Custom operators for domain-specific operations
- **Inline Functions Pattern**: Zero-cost abstractions through compile-time inlining
- **Expressions vs Statements Pattern**: Using expressions for functional programming
- **Pure Functions Pattern**: Functions with no side effects and deterministic output

### Migration Guide

#### Using the Refactored Server

**Before (v0.1.x):**

```typescript
import { createDesignPatternsServer } from './mcp-server.js';

const server = createDesignPatternsServer(config);
// Same API, better implementation
```

#### Accessing Services (for testing)

**Before:**

```typescript
import { getCacheService } from './services/cache.js';
const cache = getCacheService(); // Global singleton
```

**After:**

```typescript
import { TOKENS } from './core/container.js';
const container = server.getContainer();
const cache = container.get(TOKENS.CACHE_SERVICE); // DI Container
```

#### MCP Configuration Update

Update your `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "design-patterns": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/src/mcp-server-refactored.js"], // Changed
