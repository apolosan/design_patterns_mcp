  "description": "The Change Data Capture (CDC) pattern continuously ingests all modified rows directly from the internal database commit log. It allows lower-level and faster access to the records compared to any high-level query or processing task. The CDC consumer streams those changes and sends them to the streaming broker or any other configured output.",
  "when_to_use": "[\"Need lower ingestion latency\",\"Built-in support for physical deletes\",\"Real-time data changes\",\"Database replication requirements\"]",
  "benefits": "[\"Lower latency\",\"Captures all data changes including deletes\",\"Real-time ingestion\",\"Minimal impact on source database\"]",
  "drawbacks": "[\"Complexity in setup\",\"Data scope limitations\",\"Payload includes extra metadata\",\"Database-specific implementations\"]",
  "use_cases": "[\"Real-time data synchronization\",\"Database change streaming\",\"Event sourcing\",\"Audit logging\"]",
